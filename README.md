# MyPixel
A high-performance, scalable image processing system designed to leverage distributed computing to handle massive image processing workloads efficiently

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This project is currently in early development phase. Repository structure and core functionality is not yet implemented.

## Planned Core Features

- [ ] Distributed processing with horizontal scaling
- [ ] Node-based visual workflow editor
- [x] OpenCV integration for high-performance image operations
- [ ] Spring Batch for reliable job execution
- [x] REST API for programmatic access
- [x] Basic filters (blur, sharpen, edge detection, etc.)

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] GPU acceleration for compute-intensive operations
- [ ] Machine learning-based image analysis (object detection, face recognition)
- [ ] Advanced content-aware resizing and cropping
- [ ] Webhook notifications for job completion
- [ ] Pre-built templates for common transformations
- [ ] Batch optimization for similar operations
- [ ] Comprehensive image metadata preservation
- [ ] OAuth2 authentication and fine-grained permissions
- [ ] Integration with different cloud storage providers

## Planned Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Apache Kafka
- OpenCV
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- React (for web interface)
